This repo provides a reference implementation of **DSPM** as described in the paper:

> Improving Monaural Speech Enhancement with Dynamic Scene Perception Module

> Accpted by ICME, 2022. 

## data preprosessing

105 types of noise are concatenated for training and validation, while 110 types of noise for testing (add 5 unseen noises).  The ratio of the invisible part to the visible part of our test noise is about 4:1 (5 unseen noises vs. 105 seen noises, 20 minutes vs. 5 minutes)

The  experimental platform  is  Ubuntu  LTS  18.04  with  i7-9700  and  RTX  2060.
